# FirstPortfolio (UCSD Challenge 2)

## Description

Provide a short description explaining the what, why, and how of your project. Use the following questions as a guide:

- I made a portfolio page from scratch using HTML & CSS. 
- I wanted a webpage to showcase my projects and my own UI/UX skills.
- I can now use this webpage as a way for future employers to see my programming prowess. 
- This portfolio has taught me flexbox and building mobile-friendly webpages from scratch.

## Installation

- Live deployment in GitPages. No installation is needed to see the portfolio.

## Usage

- When accessing the GitPages deployment, you will be presented with a navbar. Hovering over the different "tabs" will underline the text, and clicking on it will scroll you down to the appropiate section.
- Alternatively, clicking on the 'Resume' text will redirect you to my LinkedIn page.

- Going to the 'works' section, the main project will be bigger than the other projects below. Hovering over the project text will change the project box's color & apply a box shadow to it. Only the main project, and side project 3 & 4 boxes contain links.

- At the 'contact me' section, each form of contact is linked accordingly for ease of communication.
